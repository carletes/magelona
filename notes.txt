Text versions
=============

Latin-1 and UTF-8 versions are provided.

Non-breakable spaces are used.

The UTF-version uses German-style quotation marks. Unitame handles the
UTF-version just fine, apart from transforming German-style quotes to
English-style.


HTML version
============

Passes W3C's HTML and CSS validation tests.


For the PPVer
=============

There are several occurences of the expression "um Gottes willen", but just a
single one of "um Gottes Willen". On the PM's suggestion, I've left the single
capitalised occurence untouched.

There are several occurences of the word "Crappana", and a single one of
"Crapona". I've left it untouched.
